#### UI

right now I am using `Bootstrap`, which is a CSS framework.
I would like trying out real UI frameworks that wraps the CSS
and offers React components, such as:

- https://material-ui.com/
- http://react.semantic-ui.com/
- https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction
- https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/

I wasn't aware of other declarative frameworks so I used Bootstrap
and wrote my own declarative components over it


#### symlinks
```bash
ln -s "$PWD/test2" ps2dl
```

#### two app skins
I wrote one app with `Bootstrap` and the other with `Material-UI`
